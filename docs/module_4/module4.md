# Module 4 - F5 Application Services Templates

F5 Application Services Templates (FAST) are an easy and effective way to deploy applications on the BIG-IP system using AS3.

The FAST Extension provides a toolset for templating and managing AS3 Applications on BIG-IP. FAST will replace the TCL based iApps over time.

Throughout this lab we only touched the BIG-IP to verify API declared configuration. During this lab we will use the BIG-IP GUI to deploy FAST at first.

After having explored the FAST GUI, it is time to return to our new habbit and use REST API to deploy FAST.

FAST can be used to build custom templates, but this is out of scope for this workshop, for now.
