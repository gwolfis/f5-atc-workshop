Module 5 - Telemetry Streaming (TS)
***********************************

This time we will use an AS3 declaration to add a WAF policy to the configuration. This WAF policy does not exist on the BIG-IP and will get pulled from an external resource. Next exercise will demonstrate how F5 Big-IP can integrate with Azure Sentinel and leverage Telemetry Streaming.

This task will cover:
 - Deploy Azure Sentinel
 - Create an event listener
 - Deploy AS3 declaration, including a WAF policy
 - Deploy a Telemetry Streaming declaration
